This is example of authorization service. Use for microservice architecture.

#### You can find here an alternative approach of how to use routing in Express.js.
#### ts-express-decorators package has greatly impressed me to make this approach.
#### The following TypeScript experimental functions: Experimental Decorators and emitDecoratorMetadata were used here.
#### All routes of request handlers were made by means of decorators.
#### This kind of development makes the process easier and quicker.
#### I think it is better to use this approach for the development of monolithic applications.
#### But I also used it for the development of separate services in the microservice architecture. 
#### While making complicated applications, we should divide all business logic into several controllers: LoginController, ProductController, OrderController, PaymentController, etc. 

#### Each controller has its unique set of request handlers.
#### It allows to improve the structure of the application and to make the code more understandable.
